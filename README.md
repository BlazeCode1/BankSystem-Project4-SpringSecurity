# BANK SYSTEM (WITH SECURITY)

in this project, i used JWT instead of Basic Auth, for how easy it is and compatible. i hope you enjoy it and if there is anything to question about do tell!


# Models
- Account
- Customer
- Employee
- User (BASE FOR REGISTRATION)
- Mail (was going to do it for otp but there is no time..)
- AuthResponse (for JWT Token)
- LoginRequest (for override auth login endpoint)
